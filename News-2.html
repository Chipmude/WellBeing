                  <h4>Tuberculosis takes lives</h4>

                    Background
                    Tuberculosis in Zambia is a major public health problem, however the country does not have reliable baseline data on the TB prevalence for impact measurement; therefore it was among the priority countries identified by the World Health Organization to conduct a national TB prevalence survey
                    

                    Introduction
                    The burden of tuberculosis (TB) in Zambia is among the highest in the African region and in 2013 the prevalence was estimated at 388/100,000 population according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and an estimated incidence rate of 427/ 100 000 population; TB is one of the major public health problems in the country with a notification rate of 289/ 100 000 population of all forms of TB in 2012. Zambia was one of the 22 high priority countries selected by the World Health Organization (WHO) to undertake a national TB prevalence survey [1], because it met the criteria as defined by the WHO Global Task Force on TB Impact Measurement [2]. Historically, there have been no national TB prevalence surveys that have been conducted in Zambia. Therefore, the country lacked baseline data on the prevalence of tuberculosis disease (TB). The WHO recommends implementation of population-based prevalence surveys to estimate the prevalence of TB for baseline and consequently impact assessment to measure progress [2, 3].
                    
                    Currently, Zambia is relying on routine surveillance data from health facilities collected through the national TB control program, to measure progress towards TB control targets. This data has limitations such as under-reporting, and it does not provide information on the number of undetected cases in the community and on those individuals seeking care outside of the public sector. The HIV pandemic and poverty in the Country may have also led to increase in the TB burden; furthermore, routine surveillance data may have gaps due to recording and reporting bias [4]. Therefore, a nationally representative population-based survey was conducted to estimate the burden of disease to inform policy makers and to provide baseline data for measurement of program achievements.
                    
                    The aim of the survey was to estimate the adult (15 years and older) prevalence of sputum and culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The other objectives were to study the health seeking behaviour and the association between household income and TB disease among the TB cases.
                    
                    Go to:
                    Materials and Methods
                    The study was a nationally representative cross sectional community based survey among households in selected clusters. A sample size of approximately 54,400 adults (aged 15 years or more) was targeted to estimate the prevalence of pulmonary TB based on the following assumptions: Prevalence of smear-positive pulmonary TB = 199/100,000 population [5] with a precision of 25%; a design effect of 1.5 and expected response rate of 85%.
                    
                    The 66 clusters were selected in 49 districts in all the 10 provinces of Zambia. These were randomly selected, following a two-stage probability proportion-to-size (PPS) sampling strategy. The average cluster size was 825 inhabitants. The sampling frame consisted of a list of Census Supervisory Areas (CSAs) as primary sampling units (PSUs) from all administrative areas.
                    
                    Data collection was implemented using three field teams between September 2013 and July 2014. The country was zoned into three regions and each team was assigned a specific region.
                    
                    In each cluster, the census team conducted household visits to register all eligible household members, and to administer a social economic questionnaire to household heads. The electronic census register and socioeconomic questionnaire were pre-loaded on the Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) before the field teams started to conduct the survey in the cluster.
                    
                    All eligible household members (individuals meeting the inclusion criteria and who had slept in the house during the previous 24 hours before the census team visited the households, irrespective of nationality) were invited to a central survey site located within the cluster. The inclusion criteria was based on individuals living in households within the selected clusters who were 15 years or older; were able to give informed consent and had slept in the household in the previous 24 hours prior to survey team visit. The individuals who met the exclusion criteria were those aged less than 15 years or were unable to understand the information given to them because they were deaf and a sign language interpreter was not at hand at time of recruitment; or they had speech impediments and thus could not communicate; or if they were incapacitated by disease such that they could not understand the information given to them. Others who were excluded were people that were considered to be living in institutional settings, such as prisons, boarding schools, military camps, Hotels and Lodges. Individuals who were unable to provide consent or assent were also excluded.
                    
                    The definitions of TB as per the national protocol were: (i) Acid fast bacilli (AFB) positive smear which was a Fluorochrome-stained smear with at least one acid fast bacilli in 40 fields (ii) Smear positive pulmonary TB patient was a patient with at least one specimen positive for AFB by smear microscopy (iii) A Culture positive pulmonary TB patient was a patient with Mycobacteria Growth indicator Tube positive showing presence of AFB and coding By Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain and identified with TAUNS (capillia) test as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex within the maximum incubation period of 42 days. (iv) A bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB patient was a patient with smear-positive and/or culture-positive pulmonary TB (or Xpert MTB/RIF positive). (v) New smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patient was a smear-positive pulmonary TB patient having no history of treatment for tuberculosis or had taken anti-tuberculosis drug for less than a month.
                    
                    Consenting eligible participants were screened for TB symptoms using a structured questionnaire and underwent chest x-ray (CXR) screening using mobile digital CXR units to determine their eligibility to submit sputum for laboratory investigation (presumptive TB patients). A normal chest X ray was defined as an X-ray showing clear lung fields and no abnormality detected whereas an abnormal chest X ray was defined as one showing any lung abnormality (e.g. opacities, cavitation, fibrosis, pleural effusion, calcification, any unexplained or suspicious shadow) and heart abnormalities detected on interpretation by a qualified medical officer. The Chest X-rays were initially read in the field immediately by Medical officers and then images were electronically transmitted to the central radiology unit at the University Teaching Hospital where they were re-read by a specialised Radiologist. They was a panel of four specialized radiologists who were at all at post graduate level of qualification and each had at least more than ten years’ experience involved in reading the X-rays.
                    
                    The PDAs were programmed to automatically identify presumptive TB patients based on the outcome of either the symptom-screening interview or field CXR examination. Household members reporting to have any of the following symptoms: cough for ≥ 2 weeks, or fever for ≥ 2 weeks, or chest pains for ≥ 2 weeks, or those with abnormal shadows on chest CXR or indeterminate CXR findings were requested to submit two sputum samples, one on the spot and one morning sample. After the collection in the field, the clearly labelled sputum specimen’s containers were sealed by tightening the screw cap and cleaning with bleach any contamination on exterior of the container. Each container was packed in a zip-locked leak-proof plastic bag with biohazard label. The sputum specimens were kept cool and stored a cool box with ice packs and were transported to the laboratories under same conditions in a refrigerated cool box or one with ice packs to reduce culture contamination rates. All sputum specimens were transported from the field within three or less days (five days was the maximum transport time). A courier system was in place to ensure that the specimens were delivered within the specified timelines. The specimens were processed within 5 days from the date of collection.
                    
                    The samples were examined for AFB smear using the Auramine-Phenol method and liquid culture (BACTEC TM MGIT TM 960) at any of the three central reference laboratories (CRLs). Each sample was digested and decontaminated using the Sodium Hydroxide N-acetyl-L-Cysteine (4%NaOH-NALC) method and inoculated into one MGIT media and incubated in automated MGIT machines. The remaining deposits were used for concentrated AFB smear microscopy using Fluorescent Microscopy technique. The inoculum was plated on a non-selective blood agar plate and incubated for 24 hours. The remaining inoculum was stored at 4°C and only discarded after the outcome of the contamination check. Culture reading was performed daily and confirmation of positive Mycobacteria tuberculosis growth was done by Acid fastness on ZN stain and Capillia Test. All isolates, both M. tuberculosis and Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria, were stored at -70°C.
                    
                    Additionally, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was performed to confirm MTB positivity for all smear positives cases. Samples from cases with culture indeterminate and CXR suggestive of TB were also subjected to XpertMTB/RIF assay (Xpert).
                    
                    Quality assurance for AFB Smear Microscopy was conducted in such a way that all the slides were examined by trained biomedical technical personnel meeting national AFB smear microscopy proficiency test standards. The slides were stored serially after examination and were prepared for blinded re-checking of a random sample that was conducted at the end of each cluster operation. A negative and positive (+1) control for every 24 slides stained was included. Internal quality control for culture was done using the reference strain H37Rv as a positive control and sterile phosphate buffered solution as a negative control. The controls were included in every batch of 14 samples run. 3 ml of suspension of 0.5 McFarland’s H37Rv bacterial suspension and 3 ml of sterile PBS were included in each batch of samples run. The participants who were eligible to submit sputum underwent an in-depth interview, using an electronic structured questionnaire. After completing TB related procedures, all consenting survey participants were also offered HIV counselling and testing on an opt-out basis. If the participant agreed to participate, the HIV testing and counselling was conducted in accordance with national algorithm. Participants who consented to HIV testing had their blood collected through a finger prick and blood was placed directly onto the screening rapid test strip (Determine™). Pre-test and post-test counselling was provided to all participants who choose to know their results. Pre-test counselling was done prior to testing. The counselling was performed by trained nurse counsellors. Participants had an option to be informed or not on the results of their HIV test. If the test was non-reactive, a negative result was communicated to the participant. However, if the test was reactive, the participant was asked to give a second blood sample from another finger prick for a confirmatory test (Uni-Gold™ Recombigen®). If the second test was reactive, the participant was informed of the positive status, appropriately counselled and referred for further management to the nearest health facility which was already identified in the vicinity of each and every survey cluster. If the second test was non-reactive, the result was considered indeterminate and the participant was advised to visit the nearest health facility for a further testing after six weeks.
                    
                    Eligible adults who failed to show up at the survey site for screening, were followed up at household level by Community Health Volunteers (CHVs). During the follow up visit, individuals found to be either very old, sick or physically incapable of going to the survey site were transported by the survey team’s vehicle.
                    
                    All cases found to have TB according to the national TB treatment guidelines were referred to the nearest health facility for further evaluation and treatment. The survey coordinator was responsible for notifying TB cases to the provincial and district TB officers in the clusters for further case management.
                    
                    The survey generated mostly digital data with the exception of participant invitation cards, consent forms and hard copy QA questionnaires. A unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) was used in all the stages of data collection and data management. The PIN was converted into a barcode which were used on all forms, registers, specimen containers, results and in digital data files to identify each survey participant.
                    
                    Data files from the field (on PDAs), the CRLs and the CXR were stored electronically, cleaned and validated separately before being merged in the final MS Access database at the data management unit (DMU). The merge key was the PIN which had been entered in the separate data files from the field, the CRLs and the CXR by reading the barcode of the participant.
                    
                    Case definition meetings were held every last week of the month to consider all cases with a complete set of results. The case definition meetings were done making sure that all areas of expertise were available to undertake a case-by-case review of the results so as to classify the survey participants using a predetermined case definition framework.
                    
                    Data was analysed using the STATA software package version 12. The first stage in the analysis focused on describing eligibility, enrolment and participants by age, sex, and province and wealth tertiles. Wealth tertiles were generated by principal components analysis on a standard list of household assets and access to basic amenities. Subsequently the outcome of screening (interview and x-ray film) and sputum testing was described, disaggregating by key characteristics namely sex, age, and type of symptoms or x-ray abnormality, setting and education level. The core analysis focused on estimating the prevalence of pulmonary TB in the adult population. The recommended 3-model approach as proposed by the WHO Global Task Force on prevalence surveys was applied, in line with new guidance on best practice methods based on Floyd et al [6].
                    
                    Using a two-step approach and three different models, a robust estimate of the TB prevalence was made. As a first step a simple cluster level analysis was done whereby the prevalence rates were calculated at cluster level and then combined to one single point estimate with confidence boundaries. The second step was an individual level model analysis whereby three different logistic regression models were applied, in this article only model 3 results are presented. In Model 3, multiple missing value imputation was done only for those eligible for sputum examination that missed data on outcome. All participants screened out were considered not having TB. In a second step, using inverse probability weighting extrapolation was done to represent all eligible individuals.
                    
                    Ethical approval
                    The study protocol was cleared by the University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (UNZABREC) No: 020-08-12. Authority to conduct the survey was sought in line with the existing national guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals who agreed to participate in the survey. For minors, both the assent of the minor and the consent of the next of kin or caretakers or guardian was obtained in writing for each participant aged 15–17 years. The institutional review board (IRB) approved this consent procedure. All the consent or assent forms were recorded on standard forms which were developed for the study and these were filed in lockable cabinets at the end of each cluster operation.
